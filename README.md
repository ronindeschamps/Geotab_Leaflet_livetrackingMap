This is an intergration of the GeotabSDK library and the Leaflet Javascript library. 
The GeotabSDK is used to pull live data from a database that stores information from a Geotab tracker. 
The Leaflet map is used to display the live location in real time.

The webpage was made with the Visual Studio "Standalone Javascript React Project" template 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
